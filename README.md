# Design-and-Implement-a-Complete-ROS2-Rover-Architecture
First build the workspace using colcon build --symlink-install and source the setup file. Then launch all rover nodes (mission manager, science node, delivery action client, autonomy node, and GNSS node) using a launch file. Set the desired mission mode via the mission manager nodeâ€™s parameter /mission_mode (science, delivery, or autonomy). In science mode, the rover moves to science sites, captures images, and logs GNSS coordinates in ~/urc_logs/site_log.txt. In delivery mode, the rover executes delivery actions through the delivery action client. In autonomy mode, the rover navigates autonomously using commands published to /cmd_vel. But science logs and images are not being stored in logs directory that I created.
